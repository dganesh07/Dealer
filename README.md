# Dealer
For each deal,we are storing the deck’s configuration and score in the database(Mlab). Displaying the deck with a
button labeled "Shuffle" to deal the next deck.

Deal scoring:
Each of the four rows in the grid is home to one suit — from top to bottom: spades, diamonds,
hearts, then clubs. Each card whose suit matches its row is worth one point, i.e. each spade
that appears in the spade row is worth one point; each diamond that appears in the diamond
row is worth one point, etc.

Likewise, each of the thirteen columns in the matrix is home to one face value, ace through
king. Each card whose face value matches its column is worth one point as well
